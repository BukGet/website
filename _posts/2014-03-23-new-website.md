title: Introducing the New and Improved Website!
---

It is with great excitement that today we are unveiling our new website to you. Along with a revised look and structure, 
we have carefully laid out information in a way that is easy to find, understand, and maintain. Starting with the 
redesigned documentation page which is now generated automatically, allowing us to quickly modify and release updates should 
they arise. 

Moving on to the Status page, which now no longer DDOSs the service to give you up to date information regarding the 
availability. We have also placed an indicator in the header on all pages to give you quick access to the state of the API. 
Allowing you to spend less time worrying, and more making great tools.

Up next, we have the news section featuring large headlines, easy to scan text with a beautiful vertical rhythm, and all of 
that other typographic talk. Allowing us to provide you with up to date information on what we are up to, and where things 
are headed.

So, whats next? That's up to you. Show us what you've made, show the world.

Welcome, to the new Bukget website.
