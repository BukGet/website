# BukGet API Documentation
## About
BukGet is an API for getting data about bukkit plugins. The system parses [BukkitDev](http://dev.bukkit.org) every 6 hours and looks for new changes in the data to update. All of this is automatic and happens without any developer intervention. Furthermore if you notice any issues, we encourage you to click the issues menu item above and open a ticket with us. This is the only way we can know about parser errors or issues and make any needed corrections. Below is the schedule that BukGet uses for generating the data. Keep in mind that if you update a plugin, it can take just over 6 hours for your plugin to hit the index.

## Recommended usage guidelines
We recommend that when communicating to the API, that you use a custom User-Agent string (UA String) to identify your application. We are tracking these UA strings and are using these to determine what applications are utilizing the API. If you have any questions about User Agent strings, please contact us in the IRC channel.

## Exposed internal flags

The following items may be exposed via the API, however are used internally by the parser and/or the APIs and are not intended for general use.

+ _use_dbo: This is an internal flag that is set on a plugin to denote that the plugin parser will use the version parsed from the DBO page over the plugin.yml version. This is pragmatically set when 3 or more plugin versions exist when there is only one unique plugin version pulled from the plugin.yml.
