### Document Format

This document uses the following conventions:

* Variables are denoted as {VARIABLE}
* All example output is mono-spaced
* Query variables are placed after a question mark at the end of a URL.  Example: "/3/?size=2"
* Fields are represented based on how deep into the document they are with dot notation.  This mimics how the queries are called.
* The hostname used by all calls is: __api.bukget.org__
* All API calls also support the callback query variable.  If set it will return the data padded with the function name specified in the callback.


## API3 Reference

### Generation Information

__Description:__

Contains various information about the last several generations in the API.  Includes things like when, what server, parsing type, how long it took, and what changes had occurred.  Optionally the user can specify how many generations back they would like to look.

__URLs:__

* /3/
* /3/geninfo

__Query Variables:__

* _size:_ Denotes the number of generations back you want to look.  By default this is set to 1.

__Field Descriptions:__

* _timestamp:_ The current UNIX time-stamp that the Generation started at.
* _duration:_ The number of seconds it took to complete the generation.
* _parser:_ The parser that this generation was run with.
* _type:_ The type of generation that was run (speedy, full, status-update are some examples).
* _changes:_ A list of the changes that had occurred in the API.
* _changes.version:_ The version of the plug-in that was updated
* _changes.plugin:_ The plug-in slug that was updated.

__Example Output:__

	:::json
	[
	    {
	        "timestamp": 1355967522,
	        "parser": "bukkit",

### Plug-in Listing

__Description:__

The plug-in listing is simply a list of plug-ins in the API.  The information can be represented however the user wishes by modifying the query attributes and pagination directly from the API is also supported.  Optionally the information can further be narrowed down based on the server platform the plug-ins are written for (e.g. bukkit).

__URLs:__

* /3/plugins
* /3/plugins/{SERVER}

__Query Variables:__

* _fields:_ Lists the fields that are to be returned.  This can be either inclusive or exclusive, however not both.  For an inclusive example, you could specify "fields=slug,description" to only return those fields, or you can specify "fields=-versions" to return everything except for the versions information.  Keep in mind the more you ask for, the more data that will come back and it may take longer to process.
* _start:_ how many documents in do you want to do before starting to display content.  This variable is used with size specifically for pagination.  The default is 0
* _size:_ How many documents do you want to return.  This variable is used with start specifically for pagination.  The default behavior is to return all documents.
* _sort:_ How do you want your data sorted?  Simply specify a field here to sort by that field.  Optionally using a "-" before the field name (denoting a negative value) the API will perform an inverse sort.

__Field Descriptions:__
