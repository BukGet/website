title: F.A.Q.

### Q: Hey, can you add X, Y, or Z?

The best way to get that on our radar is to file an issue ticket with what you would like.  From there it can be evaluated and determined if and when it could be added into the API.

### Q: How do I talk to BukGet with language X?

The API documentation and the API itself is fairly straightforward.  All responses are returned in JSON format so as long as you can send a HTTP GET and parse JSON coming back, you should be good.  That being said, if some poor souls would like to donate some example code, we can add them here ;)

### Q: Are you guys looking for help?

YES!  We are looking for people experienced in Python and MongoDB.  If you don't know either and would still like to help, feel free to click that little donation button in the sidebar and kick us back a few bucks for a beer.
